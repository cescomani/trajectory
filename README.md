# Trajectory planing using model predictive control and subgoal generation 
This project implements the trajectory planning concepts explained in `paper.pdf`.
I highly recommend this tool for solving non-lineare and optimal problems [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/tree/master/docs).
# Real world example 
It also presents an example of the application of self-driving in real situations, where one tries to avoid obstacles while maintaining a predefined path. By using sub-goal generation, the resolution time could be kept extremely small(about 100 ms).
# Topics covered are:
- Obstacle ovoidance
- Lane keeping
- Sub-goal generation and minimization of computing time
